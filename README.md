# Introduction

Eurity is a EUR fork of Liquity protocol in the Ethereum network. Eurity has core features and benefits consistent with the Liquity protocol.&#x20;

## Core Features <a href="#core-feature" id="core-feature"></a>

* 0% interest rate -- as a borrower, there’s no need to worry about constantly accruing debt
* The minimum collateral ratio of `110%` — more efficient usage of deposited collateral
* Governance free — all operations are algorithmic and fully automated, and protocol parameters are set at time of contract deployment
* Directly redeemable — mEUR can be redeemed at face value for the underlying collateral at any time
* Fully decentralized — Eurity contracts have **no admin keys** and operate without governance
* Token (ERTY) holders can earn mEUR (Borrowing fee), ETH (Redemption fee)
* USDC-mEUR farm incentivizes liquidity for USD-EUR on-chain exchange.

## How to mint mEUR? <a href="#main-use-cases" id="main-use-cases"></a>

1. Borrow mEUR against ETH by opening a Vault
2. Help Eurity by providing mEUR to the Stability Pool in exchange for rewards.
3. Stake ERTY to earn fee revenues paid for borrowing/redeeming mEUR and transferring ERTY
4. Redeem `1 mEUR` for `1 EUR` worth of ETH when the mEUR peg falls below `€1`
